In order to use our code, you will need the GDMC Framework and MCEdit. Follow these instructions [here](https://github.com/mcgreentn/GDMC/wiki/The-GDMC-Framework) to download and install GDMC Framework and MCEdit. Once this is downloaded, move all our files into the stock-filters folder. <br>
To generate both lighthouses and ships, use CreateWaterObjects filter. <br>
To generate only lighthouses, use lighthouse filter. <br>
To generate only ships, use CreateShip filter. <br>
All other files are helper files that are needed for these filters to work.
